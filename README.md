Yesterday, when I was in medical school, I considered myself _smart_.  

>I always thought that dealing with humans was challenging.
Because humans are not like computers,
where the same input always produces the same output.

Today, I've joined the MIT Emerging Talent Program to build some
computer skills, I considered myself _wise_.  

>Because, at least all humans speak a human language,
and with the help of translators,
we can find a way to communicate and deal with humans.
But the language of computers feels like technological magic,
and I am not even sure how to provide the correct inputs yet.

And completely unrelated to the topic, but I would like to share a [song][a] I love.
As they share the same name with GIT :)
