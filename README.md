## Hello World! Hallo Welt! Merhaba Dünya!🌎

<!--I know markdown doesn't want us to use an exclamation mark like this.
Because it is used when adding images, but these gestures need it, I think.
'Merhaba Dünya' is Turkish.-->

### Talking to Myself Corner💭

**A Story: From Being a Doctor to Trying to Become a Computer Witch🧙🏻‍♀️  
-_Ops, I mean Whiz, Computer Whiz_**

Yesterday, when I was in med-school, I considered myself _smart_.  

>I always thought that dealing with humans was challenging.
Because humans are not like computers,
where the same input always produces the same output.

Today, I've joined the MIT Emerging Talent Program to build some
computer skills, I considered myself _enlightened_.  

>Because, at least all humans speak a human language,
and with the help of translators,
we can find a way to communicate and deal with humans.
But the language of computers feels like technological magic,
and I am not even sure how to provide the correct inputs yet.

A message sent back from tomorrow, I am in the middle of the program,
I consider myself _wise_.

>I'm making slow and steady progress towards becoming a computer witch :)
I've learned so much about computers and coding, but the more I learn,
the more I realize Socrates was right: _'I know that I know nothing.'_
But there is no stopping, I will keep moving forward.🚀

_And one more thing,_
completely off the topic, but I would like to share a [song][a] I love.
As they share the same name with GIT.😄🎵
